Hi Mike,Â 
Attached I have a few things:
SRN: Names of the reservoirs sorted according to the Theta matrix index
Zone-1,3,4,5 reservoirs sorted in descending latitude (according to the Theta matrix index)
Theta matrix for graphical model (S_GM), and Theta matrix for graphical model with 2 latent variables (S_C)
Let me know if this helps
